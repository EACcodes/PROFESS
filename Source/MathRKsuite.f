C
C  If you are not familiar with the code SETUP and how it is used in
C  conjunction with UT or CT to solve initial value problems, you should study
C  the document file rksuite.doc carefully before attempting to use the code.
C  The following "Brief Reminder" is intended only to remind you of the
C  meaning, type, and size requirements of the arguments.
C
C  The environmental parameters OUTCH, MCHEPS, and DWARF are used in the
C  following description.  To find out their values
C
C       CALL ENVIRN(OUTCH,MCHEPS,DWARF)
C
C  INPUT VARIABLES
C
C     NEQ       - INTEGER
C                 The number of differential equations in the system.
C                 Constraint: NEQ >= 1
C     TSTART    - DOUBLE PRECISION
C                 The initial value of the independent variable.
C     YSTART(*) - DOUBLE PRECISION array of length NEQ
C                 The vector of initial values of the solution components.
C     TEND      - DOUBLE PRECISION
C                 The integration proceeds from TSTART in the direction of
C                 TEND. You cannot go past TEND.
C                 Constraint: TEND must be clearly distinguishable from TSTART
C                 in the precision available.
C     TOL       - DOUBLE PRECISION
C                 The relative error tolerance.
C                 Constraint: 0.01D0 >= TOL >= 10*MCHEPS
C     THRES(*)  - DOUBLE PRECISION array of length NEQ
C                 THRES(L) is the threshold for the Ith solution component.
C                 Constraint: THRES(L) >= SQRT(DWARF)
C     METHOD    - INTEGER
C                 Specifies which Runge-Kutta pair is to be used.
C                  = 1 - use the (2,3) pair
C                  = 2 - use the (4,5) pair
C                  = 3 - use the (7,8) pair
C     TASK      - CHARACTER*(*)
C                 Only the first character of TASK is significant.
C                 TASK(1:1) = `U' or `u' - UT is to be used
C                           = `C' or `c' - CT is to be used
C                 Constraint: TASK(1:1) = `U'or `u' or`C' or `c'
C     ERRASS    - LOGICAL
C                 = .FALSE. - do not attempt to assess the true error.
C                 = .TRUE.  - assess the true error. Costs roughly twice
C                             as much as the integration with METHODs 2 and
C                             3, and three times with METHOD = 1.
C     HSTART    - DOUBLE PRECISION
C                 0.0D0     - select automatically the first step size.
C                 non-zero  - try HSTART for the first step.
C
C  WORKSPACE
C
C     WORK(*) - DOUBLE PRECISION array of length LENWRK
C               Do not alter the contents of this array after calling SETUP.
C
C  INPUT VARIABLES
C
C     LENWRK  - INTEGER
C               Length of WORK(*): How big LENWRK must be depends
C               on the task and how it is to be solved.
C
C               LENWRK = 32*NEQ is sufficient for all cases. 
C
C               If storage is a problem, the least storage possible 
C               in the various cases is:
C
C                 If TASK = `U' or `u', then
C                   if ERRASS = .FALSE. and
C                     METHOD = 1, LENWRK must be at least 10*NEQ
C                            = 2                          20*NEQ
C                            = 3                          16*NEQ
C                   if ERRASS = .TRUE. and
C                     METHOD = 1, LENWRK must be at least 15*NEQ
C                            = 2                          32*NEQ
C                            = 3                          21*NEQ
C
C                 If TASK = `C' or `c', then
C                   if ERRASS = .FALSE. and
C                     METHOD = 1, LENWRK must be at least 10*NEQ
C                            = 2                          14*NEQ
C                            = 3                          16*NEQ
C                   if ERRASS = .TRUE. and
C                     METHOD = 1, LENWRK must be at least 15*NEQ
C                            = 2                          26*NEQ
C                            = 3                          21*NEQ
C
C                 Warning:  To exploit the interpolation capability
C                 of METHODs 1 and 2, you have to call INTRP.  This
C                 subroutine requires working storage in addition to
C                 that specified here.
C
C     MESAGE    - LOGICAL
C                 Specifies whether you want informative messages written to
C                 the standard output channel OUTCH.
C                 = .TRUE.   - provide messages
C                 = .FALSE.  - do not provide messages
C
C  In the event of a "catastrophic" failure to call SETUP correctly, the
C  nature of the catastrophe is reported on the standard output channel,
C  regardless of the value of MESAGE.  Unless special provision was made
C  in advance (see rksuite.doc), the computation then comes to a STOP.

C  If you are not familiar with the code GLBERR and how it is used in

C  study the document file rksuite.doc carefully before attempting to use 
C  the code.  The following "Brief Reminder" is intended only to remind you 
C  of the meaning, type, and size requirements of the arguments.
C
C  If ERRASS was set .TRUE. in the call to SETUP, then after any call to UT
C  or CT to advance the integration to TNOW or TWANT, the subroutine GLBERR
C  may be called to obtain an assessment of the true error of the integration.
C  At each step and for each solution component Y(L), a more accurate "true"
C  solution YT(L), an average magnitude "size(L)" of its size, and its error
C                abs(Y(L) - YT(L))/max("size(L)",THRES(L))
C  are computed.  The assessment returned in RMSERR(L) is the RMS (root-mean-

C  of the integration from TSTART through TNOW.

C  If HSTRT is equal to zero, the code is to find an on-scale initial step

C  and some preparations are made earlier.  In SETUP an upper bound is placed
C  on H that reflects the scale of the independent variable. When UTASK is
C  .TRUE., UT refines this bound using the first output point.  Here in CT
C  PHASE1 applies a rule of thumb based on the error control, the order of the
C  the formula, and the size of the initial slope to get a crude approximation
C  to an on-scale H.  PHASE2 may reduce H in the course of taking the first
C  step.  PHASE3 repeatedly adjusts H and retakes the first step until H is
C  on scale.
C
C  A guess for the magnitude of the first step size H can be provided to SETUP
C  as HSTART.  If it is too big or too small, it is ignored and the automatic
C  determination of an on-scale initial step size is activated.  If it is
C  acceptable, H is set to HSTART in SETUP.  Even when H is supplied to CT,

C
C  If you are not familiar with the code INTRP and how it is used in
C  conjunction with CT to solve initial value problems, you should study the
C  document file rksuite.doc carefully before attempting to use the code. The
C  following "Brief Reminder" is intended only to remind you of the meaning,
C  type, and size requirements of the arguments.
C
C  When integrating with METHOD = 1 or 2, answers may be obtained inexpensively
C  between steps by interpolation. INTRP is called after a step by CT from a
C  previous value of T, called TOLD below, to the current value of T to get
C  an answer at TWANT. You can specify any value of TWANT you wish, but
C  specifying a value outside the interval [TOLD,T] is likely to yield
C  answers with unsatisfactory accuracy.
C
C  INPUT VARIABLE
C
C     TWANT     - DOUBLE PRECISION
C                 The value of the independent variable where a solution
C                 is desired.
C
C  The interpolant is to be evaluated at TWANT to approximate the solution
C  and/or its first derivative there.  There are three cases:
C
C  INPUT VARIABLE
C
C     REQEST    - CHARACTER*(*)
C                 Only the first character of REQEST is significant.
C                 REQEST(1:1) = `S' or `s'- compute approximate `S'olution 
C                                           only.
C                             = `D' or `d'- compute approximate first 
C                                           `D'erivative of the solution only.
C                             = `B' or `b'- compute `B'oth approximate solution
C                                           and first derivative.
C                 Constraint: REQEST(1:1) must be `S',`s',`D',`d',`B' or `b'.
C
C  If you intend to interpolate at many points, you should arrange for the
C  the interesting components to be the first ones because the code
C  approximates only the first NWANT components.
C
C  INPUT VARIABLE
C
C     NWANT     - INTEGER
C                 Only the first NWANT components of the answer are to be
C                 computed.
C                 Constraint:  NEQ >= NWANT >= 1
C
C  OUTPUT VARIABLES

C     YWANT(*)  - DOUBLE PRECISION array of length NWANT
C                 Approximation to the first NWANT components of the true
C                 solution at TWANT when REQESTed.
C     YPWANT(*) - DOUBLE PRECISION array of length NWANT

C  Comments:
C  =========
C  Runge-Kutta formula pairs are described by a set of coefficients
C  and by the setting of a number of parameters that describe the
C  characteristics of the pair.  The input variable METHD indicates
C  which of the three pairs available is to be set. In the case of
C  METHD = 2 additional coefficients are defined that make interpolation
C  of the results possible and provide an additional error estimator.
C  VECSTG is the number of columns of workspace required to compute the
C  stages of a METHD. For interpolation purposes the routine returns via
C  COMMON the logical variable INTP indicating whether interpolation is
C  possible and via the call list:
C  REQSTG - whether the stages are required to form the
C           interpolant (set .FALSE. if INTP=.FALSE.)
C  LINTPL - the number of extra columns of storage required for use
C           with UT (set 0 if INTP=.FALSE.)
C
C  Quantities set in common blocks:
C  METHD - copy of METHOD
C  A, B, C, BHAT - coefficients of the selected method
C  R      - extra coefficents for interpolation with METHD = 2
C  E      - extra coefficients for additional local error estimate
C           with METHD = 2
C  PTR    - vector of pointers indicating how individual stages are to
C           be stored.  With it zero coefficients of the formulas can
C           be exploited to reduce the storage required
C  NSTAGE - number of stages for the specified METHD
C  INTP   - indicates whether there is an associated interpolant
C           (depending on the method, the user may have to supply
C           extra workspace)
C  MINTP  - the degree of the interpolating polynomial, if one exists
C  FSAL   - indicates whether the last stage of a step can be used as
C           the first stage of the following step
C  LSTSTG - pointer to location of last stage for use with FSAL=.TRUE.
C  ORDER  - the lower order of the pair of Runge-Kutta formulas that
C           constitute a METHD
C  TANANG, 
C  STBRAD - the stability region of the formula used to advance
C           the integration is approximated by a sector in the left half
C           complex plane.  TANANG is the tangent of the interior angle
C           of the sector and STBRAD is the radius of the sector.
C  COST   - cost of a successful step in function evaluations
C  MAXTRY - limit on the number of iterations in the stiffness check. As
C           set, no more than 24 function evaluations are made in the check.
C  NSEC   - each step of size H in the primary integration corresponds to
C           NSEC steps of size H/NSEC in the secondary integration when
C           global error assessment is done.
C  EXPON  - used to adjust the step size; this code implements an error
C           per step control for which EXPON = 1/(ORDER + 1).
C  SAFETY - quantity used in selecting the step size
C  TOOSML - quantity used to determine when a step size is too small for
C           the precision available
C  RS, RS1,
C  RS2, RS3,
C  RS4    - quantities used in determining the maximum and minimum change
C           change in step size (set independently of METHD)
C
C  Further comments on SAFETY:
C ============================
C  The code estimates the largest step size that will yield the specified
C  accuracy.  About half the time this step size would result in a local
C  error that is a little too large, and the step would be rejected.  For
C  this reason a SAFETY factor is used to reduce the "optimal" value to one
C  more likely to succeed.  Unfortunately, there is some art in choosing this
C  value. The more expensive a failed step, the smaller one is inclined to 
C  take this factor. However, a small factor means that if the prediction were
C  good, more accuracy than desired would be obtained and the behavior of the
C  error would then be irregular.  The more stringent the tolerance, the better
C  the prediction, except near limiting precision. Thus the general range of 
C  tolerances expected influences the choice of SAFETY.

C    and L.F. Shampine, Rept. 89-20, Math. Dept., Southern Methodist
C    University, Dallas, Texas, USA, 1989.  The authors are grateful to
C    P. Bogacki for his assistance in implementing the pair.  Shampine and
C    Bogacki subsequently modified the formula to enhance the reliability of
C    the pair.  The original fourth order formula is used in an estimate of
C    the local error.  If the step fails, the computation is broken off.  If
C    the step is acceptable, the first evaluation of the next step is done,
C    i.e., the pair is implemented as FSAL and the local error of the step
C    is again estimated with a fourth order formula using the additional data.
C    The step must succeed with both estimators to be accepted.  When the
C    second estimate is formed, it is used for the subsequent adjustment of
C    the step size because it is of higher quality.  The two fourth order
C    formulas are well matched to leading order, and only exceptionally do
C    the estimators disagree -- problems with discontinuous coefficients are
C    handled more reliably by using two estimators as is global error
C    estimation.

C  =========
C  The integration has reached T with a step HOLD from TOLD = T-HOLD.
C  Y(*),YP(*) and YOLD(*),YPOLD(*) approximate the solution and its
C  derivative at T and TOLD respectively.  STAGES(NEQ,*) holds the stages
C  computed in taking this step. In the case of METHD = 2 it is necessary 
C  to compute some more stages in this subroutine. CALSTG indicates whether
C  or not the extra stages need to be computed. A(*,*) and C(*) are used in 
C  computing these stages. The extra stages are stored in STAGES(NEQ,*) and 
C  XSTAGE(*).  The coefficients of the interpolating polynomials for the first
C  NWANT components of the solution are returned in the array P(*). The 
C  polynomial is of degree MINTP = 3 for METHD = 1 and of degree MINTP = 6 
C  for METHD = 2. The vector R(*) is used for workspace when METHD = 2.

C  =========
C  SRNAME indicates which routine is of interest in the call to RKSIT.
C
C  If ASK=.FALSE., then the value of STATE (which as used is the error
C  flag) for the routine SRNAME is saved internally. This value of STATE
C  is usually positive.  There are two exceptions:
C     1. SRNAME='SETUP' and STATE=-1 indicates a completely new problem,
C        so all SAVEd states are cleared.
C     2. STATE=-2 is used by some routines in the suite to indicate
C        circumstances which require special action.
C
C  If ASK=.TRUE., then RKSIT first checks to see if there were any
C  catastrophic errors, that is, a SAVEd state has value 911. This should
C  happen only when the user has overridden program termination in the event
C  of catastrophic failures from routines in the package but has failed to
C  take appropriate action. If this is the case, then RKSIT returns a value
C  of STATE = 911 which forces a termination of execution inside RKMSG. If 
C  no catastrophic errors are flagged, then STATE returns the saved state 
C  value for the routine specified by SRNAME.

C  that is considerably smaller, namely by a factor of 1/(NSEC**(ORDER+1)).
C  If the two approximate solutions are close and TOLR is neither too large nor
C  too small, this should be approximately true.  The step size is chosen in
C  the primary integration so that the local error ERR is no larger than TOLR.

C  Comments:
C  =========
C  From an approximate solution Y(*) at TNOW and first derivative there,
C  YP(*) = F(TNOW,Y,YP), a step is taken to get an approximation YNEW(*)
C  at TNOW + HTRY. The Runge-Kutta method and how it is used are defined
C  by A, B, C, BHAT, PTR, NSTAGE, METHD and FSAL. Intermediate stages
C  of the method are stored in the array STAGES(NEQ,*). The error in
C  each solution component is estimated and returned in ERREST(*). A
C  weighted maximum norm of the local error, ERR, is formed. For some
C  methods an intermediate error estimate can be computed before completion
C  of the step (see routine STEPB); if the estimate is greater than the
C  specified tolerance TOL, the computation of the step is terminated.
C
C  When global error estimation is desired, two integrations are done.
C  The usual integration is referred to as the "primary", or "main",
C  integration (MAIN=.TRUE.).  For global error estimation another,
C  "secondary" integration (MAIN=.FALSE.) is carried out with a smaller
C  step size.  The weight vector WEIGHT(*) used in computing ERR is
C  determined by the main integration.  Thus this argument is output when
C  MAIN = .TRUE. and input when MAIN = .FALSE..
C
C  When taking the first step in an integration, the logical variable
C  PHASE2 may be input as .TRUE. and if the first step is the whole of
C  the range of integration, then LAST will be .TRUE.. When PHASE2=.TRUE.,
C  the first three stages are monitored to help assure that the step
C  size H is small enough for the integration to be stable and for the
C  estimate of the error of the step to be credible. Calls are made to
C  the subroutine STEPA for this purpose. If necessary, H will be
C  reduced in STEPA (and LAST altered accordingly) and the step retried
C  in STEP until an acceptable value is found.
C
C  In the primary integration the number of calls to F is counted by
C  NFCN, and in the secondary integration, by GNFCN.

C  Comments:
C  =========
C  This subroutine is used during the first three stages of the first step.
C  A Lipschitz constant L for the differential equation in autonomous form
C  is approximated, and the product abs(HTRY)*L is compared to an approximate
C  radius, STBRAD, of the stability region of the method. The step size is 
C  reduced as necessary, within a range specified by the step size control 
C  parameters RS1 and RS4, to assure stability and give some confidence in 
C  the error estimator.  If HTRY is reduced, CUTBAK is set .TRUE..
C
C  Y(*) and YP(*) contain the solution and its derivative at TNOW and
C  similarly YSTG(*) and YPSTG(*) contain approximations at TSTG.
C
C  Normally the weights used in the control of the error depend on the
C  size of the solution at the beginning and at the end of the step, but
C  at this time we do not have a solution at the end of the step.  Each
C  stage YSTG(*) of the Runge - Kutta process represents a low order
C  approximation to the solution at TSTG.  Because the initial value of
C  WEIGHT(*) provided in the first phase of the scheme is based only on
C  the solution at T and THRES(*), it is continually updated in STEPA to
C  account for the size of the solution throughout the step as revealed
C  by the intermediate stages YSTG(*). Inside this subroutine only, the
C  differential equation is converted to autonomous form. After the
C  conversion, the end of the interval of integration, TND, is used
C  to define a suitable weight for the independent variable.

C  Update the weights to account for the current intermediate solution

C  The transformation of the equation to autonomous form is done
C  implicitly.  The difference of the arguments must take into account

C  The ratio FDIFF/ARGDIF is a lower bound for, and an approximation to, a
C  Lipschitz constant L for the differential equation written in autonomous
C  form.  First we must ask if the difference ARGDIF is significant in the 
C  precision available.  If it appears to be, we insist that abs(HTRY)*L be 
C  less than an approximate radius, STBRAD, of the stability region of the
C  method.  This is more stringent than necessary for stability, possibly a
C  lot more stringent, but the aim is to get an HTRY small enough that the
C  error estimate for the step is credible.  The reduction is required to be
C  at least as much as the step control parameter RS1. It is necessary to 
C  limit the reduction of HTRY at any one time because we may be misled in 
C  the size of the reduction that is appropriate due to nonlinearity of the 
C  differential equation and to inaccurate weights caused by HTRY much too 
C  large.  The reduction is not permitted to be more than the step control 
C  parameter RS4.

C
C  STIFFA diagnoses stiffness for an explicit Runge-Kutta code.  When it
C  is called, either many step failures have been observed, or a lot of
C  work has been done.
C
C  The NEQ equations of the problem are defined by the subroutine F(X,Y,YP).
C  When STIFFA is called, the integration has reached X where the approximate
C  solution is Y(*).  The vector FXY(*) is defined by a call of F(X,Y,FXY).
C  It is an input argument because it is usually available from the integrator.
C
C  The last successful step was of size HNOW, and an average step size is
C  HAVG.  A weighted norm is used to measure the local error with the error
C  in solution component L divided by the positive weight WT(L) provided in 
C  the vector WT(*).
C
C  Explicit Runge - Kutta codes estimate the local error of Y(*) by
C  forming the difference of two approximate solutions.  This difference
C  must be provided in the vector V0(*).  When this difference is too
C  small to be significant, STIFFA will replace it with a "random" vector.
C
C  STIF is set .TRUE. when the average step size appears to be restricted
C  on grounds of stability.  In certain cases the variable UNSURE is set 
C  .TRUE.; the value of STIF is then not defined.
C
C  The stability region of the explicit Runge-Kutta formula is described
C  by quantities TANANG and STBRAD that are communicated by the setup routine
C  via COMMON.  Stability regions often change sharply near the imaginary
C  axis so that it is difficult to classify the stiffness of a problem with
C  eigenvalues of a local Jacobian that are "near" the imaginary axis.  For
C  this reason,  we consider only points Z in the upper left half complex
C  plane for which TAN( IMAG(Z)/( - RE(Z))) <= TANANG. Eigenvalues outside
C  this region are one reason for the code being UNSURE.  The stability
C  region is approximated by the intersection of a disk with this sector.
C  The radius of this disk is called STBRAD.
C
C  Working storage must be provided via the four vectors V1(*),V2(*),
C  V3(*),VTEMP(*).  These vectors must be of length at least NEQ.

C  number of iterations will suffice.  Indeed, it is necessary to recognize 
C  a kind of degeneracy when there is a dominant real eigenvalue.  The
C  subroutine STIFFB does this.  In the first try, NTRY = 1, a Rayleigh 
C  quotient for such an eigenvalue is initialized as ROLD.  After each 
C  iteration, REROOT computes a new Rayleigh quotient and tests whether the
C  two approximations agree to one tenth of one per cent and the eigenvalue,

C  For an input vector V(*) of length NEQ, this subroutine computes a vector
C  Z(*) that approximates the product HAVG*J*V where HAVG is an input scalar 
C  and J is the Jacobian matrix of a function F evaluated at the input 
C  arguments (X,Y(*)).  This function is defined by a subroutine of the form
C  F(T,U,F) that when given T and U(*), returns the value of the function in 
C  F(*).  The input vector FXY(*) is defined by F(X,Y,FXY).  Scaling is a 
C  delicate matter.  A weighted Euclidean norm is used with the (positive) 
C  weights provided in WT(*).  The input scalar SCALE is the square root of 
C  the unit roundoff times the norm of Y(*).  The square of the norm of the
C  input vector V(*) is input as VDOTV.  The routine outputs the square of
C  the norm of the output vector Z(*) as ZDOTZ.  The subroutine calls the
C  DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION DOTPRD(U,V,WT,NEQ) to compute the dot (inner)
C  product.  The vector VTEMP(*) is used for working storage.

C
C  Comments:
C  =========
C  When a "catastrophic" failure is detected, the default action of
C  RKSUITE is to write an explanation to the standard output channel,
C  OUTCH, and STOP.  This subroutine can be used to prevent the STOP and
C  so allow the main program to continue.  To do this, you call SOFTFL with
C  ASK = .FALSE. and ON = .TRUE.  You must then call the subroutine CHKFL
C  after every call to a user-callable routine in RKSUITE to check whether
C  a catastrophic error occurred and take appropriate action if it did.  Of
C  course, you may call SETUP at any time to start a new problem, but calling
C  any other user-callable routine in RKSUITE after a catastrophic error will
C  lead to a STOP (even when "soft failure" has been set "on").
C
C  When ON is set by a call to SOFTFL with ASK = .FALSE., the value of ON
C  is SAVEd.  The subroutine RKMSG in RKSUITE calls SOFTFL with ASK = .TRUE.
C  to find out the SAVEd value of ON.
